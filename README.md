### Automate Cookie Cliker with Selenium
This project is an Auto-Clicker program developed in Python using Selenium. The primary goal of this project is to automate the process of "playing" the online game Cookie Clicker.
By utilizing Selenium, the program interacts with the web browser, providing a versatile solution for automating repetitive clicking tasks, the most import being getting cookies from the big cookie but also buying products to help speed up the process

### Features
- Element Selection: The program allows the user to specify the target element on the webpage to be clicked. For now it selects the big cookie and the product list
- Click Modes: Two click modes are available - Single Click and Continuous Click. Single Click performs a single click on the specified element, while Continuous Click repeatedly clicks the element at a user-defined interval.
- Only avaliable products: The game has a lot of products that are hidden ( need to progress to unlock them ). For performance improvements, we only click the onces that are avalaible.
